# Flightgear Simulation
This program was created in Advance Programing course in Bar-Ilan University, on 2020.

crated by Reut Berger and Eden Simony.

## Introduction
The project Written on clion in c++. We worked together on the project and
we learned a lot about how to use server and client connection.


## Description
The project connects to the simulator and make the airplane fly with
the commands in fly.txt file. We lexer and parser the commands in the file
and send a values to the simulators. In addition, we get values from the simulator
and update our data.

We use maps to get a value in o(1). the keys of the maps are the vars name or
the path of the values.

We also used thread that listens to the simulator and update our maps.

In addition, we support a while loop and if condition.


## Run Project
- Download Flight gear simulator from [here](https://www.flightgear.org/download/).
- Write in the flight simulator advanced settings:

`--telnet=socket,in,10,10.0.2,5402,tcp `

`--generic=socket,out,10,127.0.1,5400,tcp,generic_small`

- Put in the protocol folder a text file of commands and a xml file.

- Compile in terminal (on linux) with command:

`g++ -std=c++14 *.cpp -Wall -Wextra -Wshadow -Wnon-virtual-dtor -pedantic -o a.out -pthread`

- Run the out file with the command:

`a.out fly.txt`

- Click the "Fly" button on the flight simulator screen.
